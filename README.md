 Flowchart Exercises

## Requirements

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Create a pseudocode and draw a flowchart for the following exercises.
- You should use [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com) to draw the flowcharts.
- Take a screenshot and add each flowchart to the `flowcharts` folder. Use the command line to create the folder.
- Add each flowchart to the answer section of this file as image.
- Each exercise should be in a different commit.
- If you want to make changes after your commit, you should create a new commit.

## Exercise 1

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to convert the length in feet to centimeters.

Pseudocode:

- Input length in feet (LFT)
- Calculate the length in cm (LCM) by multiplying LFT by 30
- Print length in cm (LCM)
 

### Code
### Input lenght in feet (f)
### Convertion (L) <---  f * 30
### Output L
### END 

## Exercise 2

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that will read the two sides of a rectangle and calculate its area.

Pseudocode:

- Input the width (W) and the length (L) of a rectangle
- Calculate the area (A) by multiplying W by L
- Print A

### START
### Input lenght (L)
### Input lenght (W)
### Area (A) <---  L * W
### Output A
### END 


## Exercise 3

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that will read three numbers and prints the value of the largest number.

> Given that the three numbers are not equal to each other)

### START
### Input lenght (a)
### Input lenght (b)
### Input lenght (c)
### m = a > b ? (a > c ? a : c) : (b > c ? b : c)
### Output m
### END 

## Exercise 4

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to check the three number inputs whether a triangle is possible or not.

### START
### Input (a)
### Input (b)
### Input (c)
### If= (a+b)>c and (b+c)> a and (c+a)>B
### True = Print "Triangle possible" 
### False = Print "Triangle not  Possible" 
### END 

## Exercise 5

Draw the flowchart for the following:

Accept the name and marks obtained by a student in Computer Project.

Display the grades as per the table given below:

| Marks obtained                | Grade    |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| 80% or more                   | A        |
| 60% or more but less than 80% | B        |
| 40% or more but less than 60% | C        |
| Less than 40%                 | No Grade |
